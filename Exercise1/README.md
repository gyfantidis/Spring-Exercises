# Book Management System
 
Welcome to the Book Management System, a sophisticated platform designed to help you keep track of books, authors, and publishers. With this application, you can manage the relationships between books and authors, which are many-to-many, and books and publishers, which are many-to-one. This makes it easy for you to view and manage all your books, authors, and publishers in one place. You can add new authors, books, and publishers, edit existing ones, and delete them as needed. Whether you are an individual or a company, this system provides the tools you need to efficiently manage your book library.
